# Changelog

All notable changes to **dsh-remote**.

## 0.5.5 — 2026-08-15
- **Compliance fixes from the WhaleHarness audit** (https://github.com/flymysql/dsh-remote/issues/1):
  - Tool schemas no longer put `required: true` on leaf properties — required fields are now
    declared as a top-level `required: [ ... ]` array (the DSH-supported form).
  - Removed the implicit `~/.ssh/id_rsa` private-key default. `privateKeyPath` is now used
    **only when explicitly provided**; otherwise the plugin requires a password and fails with a
    clear message instead of silently reading a real key off disk.

## 0.5.4 — 2026-08-15

- **Publish metadata** — added `homepage` / `repository` / `author` / `bugs` so the
  npm page links back to the GitHub repo.

## 0.5.3 — 2026-08-15

### Workspace directory picker (fills the native “Add workspace” flow)
- The picker now renders as a **centered modal** (opaque panel + scrim), so it is
  never squeezed into the narrow sidebar.
- **Opens on the 本机 (local) tab** by default; the 远程 tab is one click away.
- **远程 / Remote**:
  - Path field **auto-prefills `/`** with a **live completion list** — selecting a
    directory immediately reveals its next level (OS/VSCode-style cascade).
  - A **浏览…** floating browser (opaque, height-capped, scrollable, follows symlinks)
    fills the field without committing; you review / edit, then **设为远程工作区**.
  - Fix: the modal no longer clips the native machine `<select>` dropdown.
- Real (desensitized, placeholder host) screenshot published in README.

## 0.5.2 — (baseline)
- Multi-machine SSH registry (add / edit / delete / set-current).
- `rw_info` `rw_connect` `rw_pick_workspace` `rw_list_dir` `rw_read_file`
  `rw_write_file` `rw_exec` `rw_sync` `rw_push` `rw_disconnect`.
- **测试连接** test-connection button. Password stored locally, never echoed.
- Directory-flow holes injected (client) at priority −100 — no `dsh-workspace`
  core is modified.
